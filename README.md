# LoraRobotRescue
LoRaWAN project.

LoraRobotRescue (LR2) is a module that can be installed on a Robot to:
- Periodically send the GPS location, the charge value of the battery and the robot
temperature via a LoRaWAN connection
- When , for example , power is under and/or temperature is over a certain threshold ,
send an alert containing these parameters ) and signal the robot to enter in power
safe mode
- Make the robot more evident , by lighting and emitting sounds, when robot owner
is looking for it

Another
advantage :
- LR2 could be a nice antitheft for your robots

So now you have no more excuses to take your robots always locked in!

You can find all related info in LR2.pdf.
